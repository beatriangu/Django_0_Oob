ex04 A basic class ft. RMS
In this exercise, you need to complete the Elem class to handle and replicating HTML elements by defining a constructor for the element's name, attributes, and tag type, implementing a __str__() method for HTML code representation, and adding a method to append content.

ex05 : Create your own elements!
Extend the Elem class by creating specific subclasses for common HTML elements like html, head, body, title, meta, img, and others. Each subclass should inherit from Elem and simplify element creation by allowing content to be passed directly. You need to demonstrate the effectiveness of these classes with tests and replicate a provided HTML structure using the new subclasses, showcasing their ease of use compared to the base Elem class.

ex06 Validation
Refine your HTML generation tools by creating a Page class that ensures HTML structure adheres to specific rules. The class will validate the HTML tree based on constraints like element types and their allowed children. It will also provide methods to print the HTML code with a doctype if the root is Html and to write this HTML to a file. Demonstrate the Page class functionality with various tests to ensure compliance and correctness.
